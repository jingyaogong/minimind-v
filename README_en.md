# üìå VLM Detail

The base language model of MiniMind-V (VLM), MiniMind (LLM), comes from the twin
project [minimind](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind). For detailed information on the model structure, training
specifics, principles, and testing results, please refer to the [minimind](https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind)
project. To reduce redundancy, the discussion on LLM-related topics is omitted here, assuming you have a basic
understanding of MiniMind (LLM).

> Even if you are not very familiar with the details of LLMs, you can still follow the "Quick Start" guide to train a
> MiniMind-V, as it remains unaffected and the repository focuses on the lowest cost for out-of-the-box use!

MiniMind-V's structure adds two submodules, a Visual Encoder and a feature projection, with a modality-mixing branch to
support inputs from multiple modalities:

<details>
<summary> [Important] Some Interesting Thoughts </summary>

Let's take a moment to think about two questions:

* What is a **Large Language Model (LLM)**?
* What is a multimodal model?

[This article](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2024-09-15-3) perfectly aligns with my thoughts:  
Although the name "large language model" (LLM) contains the word "language," they are actually not closely related to
language; this is just a historical issue. A more accurate name would be self-regressive Transformer or something else.
LLMs are more of a general statistical modeling technology, mainly using a self-regressive Transformer to simulate token
flows. These tokens can represent text, images, audio, action choices, and even molecules‚Äîanything, really.  
Therefore, as long as the problem can be converted into a process of simulating a series of discrete tokens, LLM can
theoretically solve it. In fact, with the increasing maturity of large language model technologies, we may see more and
more problems falling under this modeling paradigm. In other words, the problem is fixed in using LLM to "predict the
next token," but the role and meaning of the tokens differ in each domain.

[ZJU-LiXi](https://person.zju.edu.cn/xilics#694283) has also mentioned a similar viewpoint (roughly stated below):  
Text, video, audio, actions, etc., are considered "multimodal" signals in human perception, but the term "modality" is
essentially just a classification concept based on how humans store information. Just like `.txt` and `.png` files,
though they differ in visual presentation and higher-level forms, they are fundamentally the same. The concept of "
multimodal" arose simply because humans need to categorize these signals based on different sensory dimensions.  
However, for machines, regardless of the signal's "modality," they are ultimately presented as a sequence of binary "
monomodal" numbers. Machines do not differentiate the origin of these signals; they just process and analyze the
information contained within these sequences.

Personally, I think **Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)** is a more fitting term than **Large Language Model (LLM)
**, and I prefer to use "GPT" to represent models in the LLM/VLM/GPT-like architecture series rather than to ride on
OpenAI's coattails.

To summarize what GPTs do in one sentence:

A GPT model predicts the next, next-next, next-next-next token, etc., based on the current token... until the model
outputs the end token; here, the "token" doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be text!

```text
> For an LLM model, if we need to understand an "image," we just treat the "image" as a special "foreign language" that has never been encountered before, and translate it into the "LLM language" via a "foreign language dictionary."
> For an LLM model, if we need to understand "audio," we just treat "audio" as a special "foreign language" that has never been encountered before, and translate it into the "LLM language" via a "foreign language dictionary."
> ...
```

<u>**To obtain MiniMind-V, we only need to do these 2 things:**</u>

1. Use the **"foreign language dictionary"** that is good at translating images, to translate the image from the **"
   foreign language"** into a model-understandable **"LLM language."**
2. Fine-tune the LLM so that it and the **"foreign language dictionary"** go through a period of adaptation, thereby
   better understanding images.

The "foreign language dictionary" is referred to as the Visual Encoder model.  
Like LlaVA, Qwen-VL, and other visual language models, MiniMind-V also uses the open-source Clip series models as the
Visual Encoder.  
Specifically, we use [clip-vit-base-patch16](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch16), a classic Visual
Encoder based on the ViT-B/16 architecture for describing image-text information.  
The input image size is 224x224, and because the Patch size is 16√ó16, it generates 16*16=196 tokens as the input to the
encoder layer, which produces a 1√ó768 dimensional embedding vector for calculating error with the text.  
We don‚Äôt need the final embedding representation, so we only take the output from the encoder layer, which is the output
feature from the core ViT backbone.  
It receives the feature of size 196√ó768 from the previous layer, which we use as 196 visual tokens to input into
MiniMind-V.  
After obtaining the image encoder features, the integration with the LLM requires aligning the 768-dimensional visual
tokens with the LLM's text tokens, and mapping the image features into the same space as text embeddings. In other
words, the image features and native visual tokens cannot be directly treated the same; they require cross-modal feature
alignment.  
[LlaVA-1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08485) uses a simple unbiased linear transformation to achieve this, with great
success, and MiniMind-V does the same.

![llava-structure](./images/llava-structure.png)

With that, the internal structural changes of MiniMind-V are now fully presented.

</details>


---

Next, let's briefly discuss the changes in the external input and output of MiniMind-V.

The input to the VLM is still a segment of text containing special <image> placeholders.  
After computing the text embedding, the vector generated by the image encoder can be projected onto the corresponding
embedding part of the placeholder, replacing the original placeholder embedding.  
For example:

```text
<image>\nWhat is in this image?
```

In `minimind-v`, the image is replaced by a 196-character `@@@...@@@` placeholder. The reason for using 196 characters
is explained earlier:  
Any image is encoded by the Clip model as 196√ó768-dimensional tokens,  
thus the `minimind-v` prompt becomes:

```text
@@@......@@@\nWhat is this image describing?
```

After calculating the embedding and projection, and replacing the image token part, the entire calculation process to
output is no different from that of the LLM part.

![input](./images/minimind-v-input.png)

For handling multiple images at once, this can be achieved by injecting multiple `<image>` placeholders without needing
to modify the framework at all.

<summary> Expansion Ideas for Video Understanding </summary>

written by [@xinyanghuang7](https://github.com/xinyanghuang7)

For the video understanding capabilities of multimodal large models, one feasible approach is to refer to the existing
MiniCPM-V 2.6 Python example for video understanding.
The main idea is to extract key frames from the video and then perform multi-image inference.
Therefore, if you want to add video understanding capabilities to MiniMind-V, you can base it on the existing
multi-image training, refer to the key frame extraction method in this Python script, and increase the number of images
supported in the training files.
The more MAX_NUM_FRAMES supported, the more GPU memory it will consume.

```text
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from decord import VideoReader, cpu  # pip install decord

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6', trust_remote_code=True,
                                  attn_implementation='sdpa',
                                  torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)  # sdpa or flash_attention_2, no eager
model = model.eval().cuda()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2_6', trust_remote_code=True)

MAX_NUM_FRAMES = 64  # if cuda OOM set a smaller number


def encode_video(video_path):
    def uniform_sample(l, n):
        gap = len(l) / n
        idxs = [int(i * gap + gap / 2) for i in range(n)]
        return [l[i] for i in idxs]

    vr = VideoReader(video_path, ctx=cpu(0))
    sample_fps = round(vr.get_avg_fps() / 1)  # FPS
    frame_idx = [i for i in range(0, len(vr), sample_fps)]
    if len(frame_idx) > MAX_NUM_FRAMES:
        frame_idx = uniform_sample(frame_idx, MAX_NUM_FRAMES)
    frames = vr.get_batch(frame_idx).asnumpy()
    frames = [Image.fromarray(v.astype('uint8')) for v in frames]
    print('num frames:', len(frames))
    return frames


video_path = "video_test.mp4"
frames = encode_video(video_path)
question = "Describe the video"
msgs = [
    {'role': 'user', 'content': frames + [question]},
]

# Set decode params for video
params = {}
params["use_image_id"] = False
params["max_slice_nums"] = 2  # If cuda OOM and video resolution is greater than 448*448, set to 1

answer = model.chat(
    image=None,
    msgs=msgs,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    **params
)
print(answer)
```

</details>

At this point, all the details of `MiniMind-V` have been presented.
The `MiniMind-V` model subclass completely inherits from `MiniMind`,
and is generated with **minimal** changes based on the latter,
with core algorithm modifications `< 50 lines`, making the migration difficulty very low.
Therefore, there may be differences with models like `LlAVA`, but the overall idea remains consistent.

<summary> Data Description </summary>

* The multi-image dataset is relatively small and contains English conversations, focusing only on scenes with two image
  comparisons. Therefore, the fine-tuning effect is limited, and this is just one reference approach.

* `jsonl` contains textual instructions, and `images.zip` contains the corresponding image data (to be unzipped after

## ‚Ö° Training

> train_pretrain_vlm

Pre-training learns general image knowledge from a dataset of 595K samples, such as a deer is a deer, a dog is a dog.

> train_sft_vlm

Instruction fine-tuning learns the real Q&A format for image-related questions from a dataset of 300K real
conversations, which better aligns with human communication habits.

> train_sft_vlm

Multi-image fine-tuning provides a demo: a bird comparison dataset with 13.6k real Q&A formats.

During training, the visual encoder, i.e., the CLIP model's gradients, are frozen, and only the Projection and LLM parts
are trained.  
In pre-training, only the last layer parameters of Projection and LLM are learnable.  
In instruction fine-tuning, all parameters of Projection and LLM are learnable.

### Effect Summary:

Visual signals are treated as a special foreign language by LLMs, so the "language learning" ability highly depends on
the LLM's capacity. The stronger the LLM, the more powerful the corresponding VLM, and the performance boost becomes
significant.

#### Future Areas for Improvement:

```text
> Simpler projection-based cross-modal feature alignment, which may be inferior compared to Cross-Attention.
> The Clip model could try larger, more powerful large series for finer-grained token representations of image features, as they are still coarse.
> The resolution is not high, theoretically only 224√ó224 (the minimind-v dataset is set to 128√ó128 for space saving).
> ...
```
